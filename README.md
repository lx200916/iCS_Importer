# iCS_Importer
Try To Make iCS Import Easy on Android10+

# Why Made This
This App is used along with `UPC-ics Project`,so that u can convert `.ics` files into ur calendar. I used to recommmand `[calendar-import-export](https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export)`, but it crashes frequently due to some old codes.So I developed this app.
